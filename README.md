# DIY-RawSDL2PlatformerGame
This is a Simple SDL2-based Platformer Game, following part of [the tutorial from Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KD4Ae0tX0g&list=PL-K0viiuJ2RctP5nlJlqmHGeh66-GOZR_&index=1&t=67s). Based on that, I added some additional stuff such as the type and number of enemies, lifebar, longer map, and various sprite resources(Some of them are not used because of the pause of this game's development).



## Personal Reflection
When I developed this game, I have to follow the tutorial at first. After a while, I can add some additional functions but still don't exactly know how to properly or elegantly add that to this game. Because I have to consider expansibility, running efficiency, and the whole framework of this game. I found I've entered into a field of structure design or system design, which is really challenging but interesting. However, at the time of writing, I faced burdensome and challenging workload from graduate school, and I had to put more attention on other as interesting, challenging, and important things in school as GAME DEVELOPING.
So I put the pause button.
